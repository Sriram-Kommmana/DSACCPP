// we can use simple bfs because it has unit weights and undirected
// initialising the distance vector with infinity as the distance of each element
// initializing a queue of pairs <node, distance>
// push <src,0> into the queue
// then do a bfs and increase the distance by 1 and keep updating the distance array
// here also we dont need visited array, we are good to go with distance array, if you get a distance that is greater than the distance in the distance array then you have to reject that pair - which is not update the dist.array and not to put in queue
